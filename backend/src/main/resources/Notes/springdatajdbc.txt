Datasource: It is an object that provides connection for jdbc client to the dbms.
The Datasource connects to a connection pool. DB connection is expensive.
The client connects, perform a query then release the connection.
Flyway is a database migration. Database versioning tool.
Naming convention for files create under db.migration needs to be respected for flyway to proceed with the changes.
